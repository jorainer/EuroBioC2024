# Contribution to the EuroBioC2024 conference

This repository contains my contribution(s) to the
[EuroBioC2024](https://eurobioc2024.bioconductor.org/) conference in Oxford
(UK).

Conference will take place September 2-6 2024.

The file [abstract.md](abstract.md) contains the content of the abstract for a
poster I plan to present at the conference. Note that I do not list all
contributing authors with their full names and affiliations in the abstract, but
will include them on the poster. These includes all contributors to any of the
listed packages from the
[RforMassSpectrometry](https://rformassspectrometry.org) that are also listed on
the initiative's official [contributors
page](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/contributions/). A huge thanks again
to all these contributors!
